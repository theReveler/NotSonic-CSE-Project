Sprint number: 6
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: RandomLevelLoader
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Tre Plowman
Specific comments on code quality: While it is readable, I think the load level method could be split into another method that just parses the objects.
It appears cohesive and has high coupling which is not really something that can be avoided.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 

Adding in a few extra objects would be easy, however it could become confusing if many were added and the parser has to start using combinations of characters.
Also adding in extra randomized parts of the level would be as simple as adding in another stream and changing a few numbers.
