Date of the code review: 2.27.17
Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: sonic.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Shaun Bolan

Specific comments on code quality: contains a lot of different methods - although bound to being states of sonic, perhaps can move them into other classes to shorten the class.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: Adding any other states of sonic ie: invincibility would be easy to follow as the model is already setup, although the length is a bit much.
