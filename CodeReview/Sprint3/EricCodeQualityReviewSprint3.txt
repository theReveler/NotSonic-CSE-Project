Comments: File seems to be not maintanble by nature, has 5 dependencies (ISonic, IGameObject, IBlock, CollisionDetector, VideoMonitor). Has some Dead Code(I think it will be used later though).
A hypothetical change: create a helper method that will take care of the VideoMonitor blocks. This will make it cleaner and easier if we decided to make a new block type(ex. FallingBlock) for the game.
