Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Collision Detector
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Shaun Bolan/Tre Plowman

Specific comments on code quality: 

The code is readable and appears to be cohesive. 
Of course being a collision handler means that there will be some sort of coupling that is unavoidable.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 

If we were to add in more object types, like a boss enemy, it would not be too difficult to add in.
If classified as an IEnemy, no changes would need to be made. If it was of its own type a else if statement
checking it would need to be added to HandleCollision and a collision handler would be needed.
