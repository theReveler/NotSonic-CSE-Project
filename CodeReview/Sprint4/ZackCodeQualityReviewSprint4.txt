Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: WoodenPlatform
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Eric Salberg

Specific comments on code quality: 

Everything appears to be readble and cohesive with loose coupling.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 

If diagonal directions were to be added, or fixed paths for the platform to follow, the changes would be relatively easiy to implement with the
current implementation.
