Sprint 4 : NotSonic

For sprint 4, our burndown looks better than previous sprints. We completed the majority share of our work in the beginning of the sprint and only added or changed minor things towards the end. One mistake is a team member added max hours to one of their tasks (indicating difficulty) and for some reason after it was changed back to the normal hours and added to the finished side it still added the 999 hours. Although it makes our dedication at the beginning look very impressive!
