Warnings Suppressed for Sprint6:
In the GlobalSuppression.cs all the warnings suppressed can be found.

The warnings for lines 1-21 are for features that were not used or implemented.

For line 22-23, the warning suggests changing the return type to Collection<T>, which would
result in an error and is uneccessary.

For lines 24-25, the warnings are given for the class not implementing IDisposable
which is not needed for those classes.

For lines 26-38, the warnings are given for methods not being static, which is not
needed in these cases.
